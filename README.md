# Fun with P5JS

Using P5JS for creative coding and 2d animations. This is repository of projects that I've done with my students/collegues at work. Some of the graphic animations are used to teach basic cartesian coordinate logic, board game simulations and coding for creative personalities. Contributors are welcome!

# Block Game
The block game is similar to the logic of teris. The objective is to form a full column of the same color. Columns are formed by making transitions across the grid and placing the colors in the correct row/column coordinate. Once a column has been formed, the column will be cleared from the 2d grid. The goal is to complete the board in as little transitions as possible. Policy for how a winner hasn't been decided yet.
