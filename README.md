# Fun with P5JS

Using P5JS for creative coding and 2d animations. This is repository of projects that I've done with my students/collegues at work. Some of the graphic animations are used to teach basic cartesian coordinate logic, board game simulations and coding for creative personalities. Contributors are welcome!
