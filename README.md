# Fun with P5JS

Using P5JS to create 2D board games and build AI's to beat them. 

# 2D AI game training
1. Be able to visualize game trees and see how the AI is learning
2. Create GAN to generate rules from previous board games
3. Try to make AI's learn to play harder games trained on easier games. 
4. Create visual timeline of the AI's learning process

# Genetic algorithm visualization
1. Create environments with populations and survival rate
2. Visualize genetic algorithms
